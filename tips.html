    <h1>Travel tips: Expert advice for an amazing trip to Japan</h1><br><br><br>
    <br><h2>1. Decide When to Visit to Japan</h2>
<p>Japan is truly a year-round destination. Each season brings its own highlights, from cherry blossoms in spring and festivals in summer, to the stunning foliage of autumn and epic skiing in winter. Any time you visit, you’ll find plenty to enjoy. The best time of year to visit Japan depends on your preferences for weather and crowds, and which experiences you most desire.</p>
<br><h2>2. Venture Outside the Big Cities</h2>
<p>When you think of Japan, the first places you think of are probably the big-name cities of Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. These are amazing places to visit, but by no means everything the country has to offer. To gain a deeper understanding of Japan, try exploring some of the more off-the-beaten-path destinations – especially if this is not your first trip. Head north to the wilds of Hokkaido, visit the peaceful villages of Shikoku, or explore some of Okinawa’s achingly beautiful islands. Not only will you escape the crowds, but you’ll also get a glimpse of some of the most authentic and memorable parts of Japanese culture.</p>
<br><h2>3. Spend a Night in a Ryokan</h2>
<p>A ryokan is a traditional, Japanese-style inn, and we highly recommend staying a night or two in one during your trip. Ryokan are very different from regular hotels, and a quintessential part of the Japanese experience. The majority are located in the countryside, providing the perfect opportunity to unwind, rejuvenate, and enjoy the very best of Japanese hospitality. Complete with minimalist tatami mat rooms, yukata robes, kaiseki meals, onsen baths, and futon bedding, you’re guaranteed to find it an experience like no other!</p>
<br><h2>4. Discover True Relaxation at an Onsen</h2>
<p>Japanese onsen (hot springs) resorts provide the ultimate in luxury and relaxation. Whether you choose a historic indoor bath or a remote outdoor location surrounded by breathtaking natural scenery, they are a sublime, authentic cultural experience that you won’t encounter anywhere else.</p>
<br><h2>5. Stay in a Buddhist Temple</h2>
<p>For even more of an escape from everyday life, a spiritual retreat at a Buddhist temple is just the ticket. Visitors can get a taste of Buddhist life by staying at a shukubo (temple lodging), where you can take part in early morning prayers, meditation classes, and traditional Buddhist vegetarian cuisine. Some stays will also give you the option to help out with work around the temple as a form of active meditation.</p>
<br><h2>6. Attend a Matsuri (Festival)</h2>
<p>Japan’s matsuri (festivals) are nothing short of spectacular. Rich in tradition and bursting with color and energy, they showcase the country at its most dynamic and lively. Attending a festival during your trip will be an unforgettable experience: a chance to try authentic and seasonal street food, witness unique traditions, and immerse yourself in an important part of Japanese life.</p>
<br><h2>7. Cheer at a Sumo Tournament</h2>
<p>To get an insight into a very different side of Japanese culture, consider attending a sporting event such as sumo – even if you’re not a sports fan. Sumo tournaments are all-day events steeped in ancient tradition — and they take place just six times a year. If you can’t make it to a tournament, there’s also the option to go to a sumo exhibition or morning practice. All the details you need are in our guide to sumo in Japan.</p>
<br><h2>8. Check Passports and Visas</h2>
<p>Your passport should have at least six months’ validity from the end date of your visit, and two to four blank visa pages are recommended. When it comes to visas, you might not need one – citizens of these countries can enter Japan without a tourist visa, usually for 90 days. Always check with the Japanese Embassy for the most up-to-date information before you travel.</p>
<br><h2>9. Learn Some Key Japanese Phrases </h2>
<p>First of all – don’t panic! It’s entirely possible to travel around Japan without knowing the language. Most Japanese people speak a little bit of English, and you’ll find plenty of English-language signage in big cities and popular tourist locations. Having said that, learning a few Japanese phrases can significantly enhance your overall travel experience in Japan. It’s a rich and fascinating language, and Japanese people really appreciate tourists making an effort to learn it – even if only the most basic of phrases! Go to the Instant Japanese tab to get started with some carefully-selected words and phrases.</p>
<br><h2>10. Think Before You Tip</h2>
<p>Tipping is pretty much unheard of in Japan, despite the phenomenal level of customer service. In fact, if you try to leave a tip, it will almost definitely be turned down – making for a potentially awkward moment. If you want to show your appreciation to someone like a private guide or interpreter, one alternative is to bring a small gift from your home country.</p>
<br><h2>11. Take Off Your Shoes</h2>
<p>Before entering homes, ryokan, certain temples, traditional restaurants, and any area with tatami matting, you will need to take off your shoes. It’s advisable to wear shoes that slip on and off easily because you’ll be doing this a lot! Some places provide indoor slippers for you to wear, but this won’t always be the case. For instance, on tatami it’s generally best to wear socks in order to protect the matting. As such, it’s a good idea to wear decent, hole-free socks – or bring a pair with you if you’re not wearing any.</p>
<br><h2>12. Watch Out For Bathroom Slippers</h2>
<p>During your travels in Japan, you may notice that certain places, like homes and ryokan, have slippers exclusively for use in the bathroom. When you enter the bathroom, leave your regular slippers outside the door and switch to the bathroom slippers. These should only be worn in the bathroom, so don’t forget to change back when you leave.</p>
<br><h2>13. Taxi Doors</h2>
<p>Japan is famous for technology and efficiency, so it should come as no surprise that taxi doors open automatically. When you hail a taxi, the driver will pull up, and the rear door will automatically open for you to get in. Once inside, it will close again automatically behind you.</p>
<br><h2>14. To Bow or Not to Bow</h2>
<p>Bowing is one of the most commonly seen Japanese customs, and it’s used in a wide variety of situations, including greeting people, thanking someone, and apologizing. As a general rule of thumb, the deeper the bow, the more respectful it is. Don’t worry if you feel uncomfortable at first. Most Japanese people know that bowing is uncommon in the west, and they won’t be scrutinizing your efforts! If you’d prefer to shake hands instead, that will most likely be fine too.</p>
