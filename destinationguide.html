        <h1>Destination guide: Find your Destination</h1>
        <br><br><h2>Hokkaido</h2>
        <p>Hokkaido is a popular destination for skiing and snowboarding in winter, thanks to its abundant powder snow and top resorts like Niseko, Rusutsu and Furano. Sapporo, Hokkaido’s main city, famous for Sapporo beer, Sapporo ramen and the annual Sapporo Snow Festival. Hakodate is a traditional port with charming historical areas and gorgeous night views. Hokkaido’s mild summers provide relief from Japan’s humidity, and the perfect conditions for hiking and exploring the many National Parks. Much of Hokkaido is wild and unspoiled, with natural hot springs, volcanic lakes and unforgettable experiences. Explore the culture and traditions of the indigenous Ainu people at Lake Akan, and journey to the Shiretoko Peninsula to see free-roaming brown bears, foxes and deer.</p>
        <br><h2>Tohoku</h2>
        <p>The Tohoku region of Japan is home to unspoiled rural landscapes and historical treasures, outdoor summer adventures and endless powder snow in the winter. Japan's northeastern wilderness is a huge region encompassing six rural prefectures, bound together by custom, heritage and recent tragedy. The devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck in 2011 brought out the resilient nature of Tohoku's people, and local passion and pride are putting the area back on its feet. There's a lot to be proud of—dramatic landscapes, history-rich sites, craft sake and a host of outdoor activities like rafting, hiking and skiing. Much more rural than Tokyo yet more developed than Hokkaido, the Tohoku region makes for exciting excursions from the capital and memorable side trips on the journey to the northernmost region of Japan's main island.</p>
        <br><h2>Hokuriku Shinetsu</h2>
        <p>With the convenient high-speed bullet train connecting Tokyo to most of Hokuriku Shinetsu in two and a half hours or less, the soaring mountains of the Japan Alps, views of Japan's west coast, and cities and towns thriving with refined culture are all within easy reach. Of Hokuriku's five prefectures, Nagano is the only one without a coastline, but together with Niigata, it offers some of the best skiing and snowboarding in Japan. Toyama and Fukui prefectures present an elusive and appealing slice of rural Japan, while Ishikawa is home to art and culture, with its capital city Kanazawa the center of both traditional and modern Japanese design.</p>
        <br><h2>Kanto</h2>
        <p>Megacity Tokyo fully engages the senses with its mix of modern bustle and traditional tranquility. But before jetting off to Kyoto or further afield, allow yourself to discover Kanto's hot spring resorts, unspoiled mountain gorges, pristine beaches, UNESCO World Heritage sites and cultural treasures. The diverse port city of Yokohama and the immersive nature of Gunma, Saitama and Ibaraki are right on Tokyo's doorstep. The volcanic Ogasawara Islands offer a subtropical getaway with endemic wildlife and clear water. Kanto's culinary options are as varied as the landscape—restaurants serving cuisine from every corner of the globe abound at every price point.</p>
        <br><h2>Tokai</h2>
        <p>Served by the shinkansen between Tokyo and Kyoto, the Tokai region features both world-renowned destinations and local splendor. A quintessentially Japanese region, the prefectures that comprise Tokai mix ancient heritage, modern industry and stunning nature. Mt. Fuji, flanked by the hot springs of Hakone and the Fuji Five Lakes, is one of the world's most iconic peaks. Tokai both embraces the past and looks toward the future with World Heritage site Shirakawa-go and its thatched-roof cottages, the nation's biggest green tea plantations, Toyota Motor Corp. and Ise-Jingu, the most revered shrine in Japan.</p>
        <br><h2>Kansai</h2>
        <p>Experience fantastic nightlife, peaceful temples and shrines, and soul-searching pilgrimages. Kansai is Japan's spiritual and cultural capital, shaped by towering Osaka and Himeji castles, Zen gardens and arduous journeys to enlightenment. The nation's ancient capitals of Kyoto and Nara are filled with cultural and historical sites, while Koyasan in Wakayama has been a religious destination for centuries. Nearby, you can revel in the raucous nightlife of Osaka's entertainment districts and take in panoramic views of the Kobe cityscape.</p>
        <br><h2>Chugoku</h2>
        <p>With its well-known history and famed floating shrine, it is hard to overlook Hiroshima, but this popular destination is merely the entry point to western Japan for those in the know. Continue west following the Sanyo Shinkansen and you'll discover idyllic seaside towns and island-hopping opportunities on the Seto Inland Sea, with onward paths to Kyushu and Shikoku. Venture inland on the road less traveled, and your efforts will be rewarded with hikes on breathtaking peaks like Mt. Daisen divine natural landscapes, and the excitement of discovery in Shimane and Tottori.</p>
        <br><h2>Shikoku</h2>
        <p>Shikoku might be the smallest of Japan's four major islands, but it packs a big natural and cultural punch. It boasts picturesque coastline on the glittering Seto Inland Sea, legendary udon noodles, movie-inspiring onsen, the first step on the Shikoku 88 Temple Pilgrimage and a summer stage for Japan to dance. It also provides the setting for Japanese literary giant Natsume Soseke's classic, "Botchan." If you're looking to delve into a more traditional Japan, it's time to explore vibrant Shikoku.</p>
        <br><h2>Kyushu</h2>
        <p>Japan’s third-largest island is internationally famous for its tonkotsu ramen, varied hot springs, dramatic mountains, and peaceful beaches. While the startup hub of Fukuoka bubbles with international attention, the volcanic terrain to the south continues to rumble and smoke. The seismic activity has created a craggy wonderland of eight steaming hot spring areas, known collectively as Beppu Onsen, as well as soaring peaks to hike, such as Mt. Karakuni in the Kirishima mountain range. Offering a taste of both cutting-edge modernity and slow-paced living, Japan's southern island is best explored at a leisurely pace. Head south to relax on an island bursting with spectacular nature, culture and cuisine.</p>
